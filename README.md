# Sentiment-Analysis-Model-Development-and-Evaluation

## Overview

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text into **positive, negative, or neutral sentiments**. The workflow includes **data cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, model training using machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM), evaluation, and visualization**.

## Features

✅ Clean and preprocess raw text data (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)  
✅ Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
✅ Model training using:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine

✅ Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
✅ Visualization of confusion matrices and word clouds  
✅ Predict sentiment on new user inputs

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- wordcloud

You can install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk wordcloud
```

## Usage

1️⃣ Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SentimentAnalysis
```

2️⃣ Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook SentimentAnalysis.ipynb
```

3️⃣ Run all cells sequentially to:
- Load and explore the dataset
- Preprocess the text data
- Train models
- Evaluate performance
- Visualize results
- Test on new input text

## Dataset

The dataset consists of:
- **Text**: Sentences or reviews on which sentiment analysis is performed.
- **Label**: Sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

## Results

- Achieved **XX% accuracy** (replace with your result) using [best model].
- Visualized most frequent words using word clouds.
- Confusion matrices illustrate model performance clearly across classes.

## Future Improvements

✅ Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy  
✅ Integration of deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)  
✅ Deployment as a Flask web app for real-time sentiment prediction  
✅ Visualization dashboard with Streamlit or Dash
